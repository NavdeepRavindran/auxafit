**AI Fitness Coach Application**


**Project Overview**

The AI Fitness Coach application is a personalized fitness companion built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses artificial intelligence to create adaptive workout routines based on user inputs such as energy levels, mood, work schedule, and even gender-specific training needs (e.g., adjusting workouts based on menstrual cycles). This app helps users stay on track with their fitness goals while offering mental and emotional coaching, making it a truly holistic fitness experience.

**Features**

Hybrid AI + Human-Like Coaching:
     AI dynamically adjusts training plans with personalized psychological check-ins and motivation.

Work-Life Adaptive Training Plans:
     Suggests alternative workouts if there are disruptions in your schedule, such as travel or work commitments.

**Emotional & Mental Coaching:**
     AI checks on your energy levels, mood, and stress, providing motivation and support based on how you're feeling.

Gender-Specific Training:
     For women, the app adjusts workout intensity based on menstrual cycles for optimal training and recovery.

Tracking Progress:
     Keeps a record of workouts, calories burned, and progress with visualizations.

AI Chat:
     Motivational AI-driven chat support to provide encouragement and answer fitness-related questions.
